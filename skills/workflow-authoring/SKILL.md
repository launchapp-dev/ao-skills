# Workflow Authoring

Project-authored workflow sources live in `.ao/workflows.yaml` and `.ao/workflows/*.yaml`.

Do not read every reference file up front. Start with the smallest change that solves the task, then open only the reference that matches the section you are editing:

- Read [references/agents-and-phases.md](references/agents-and-phases.md) for agent or phase fields.
- Read [references/top-level-and-routing.md](references/top-level-and-routing.md) for the real top-level authored surface, workflow composition, variables, and post-success hooks.
- Read [references/automation-and-integrations.md](references/automation-and-integrations.md) for `phase_mcp_bindings`, `tools`, `integrations`, `schedules`, `triggers`, and `daemon`.
- Read [mcp-servers-for-agents](../mcp-servers-for-agents/SKILL.md) only when wiring external MCP servers.

Prefer `workflows:` as the authored surface. Some AO docs still mention `pipelines:`, but `ao-cli`'s current workflow YAML parser, types, and tests are centered on `workflows:`.

## Minimal skeleton

Start from the smallest valid shape and expand only where the task needs more structure:

```yaml
agents:
  default:
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
    tool: claude

phases:
  implementation:
    mode: agent
    agent: default
    directive: Implement the task.

workflows:
  - id: standard
    name: Standard
    phases: [implementation]
```

## Authoring flow

1. Inspect the existing YAML before adding new sections.
2. Add or update only the sections the task actually touches.
3. Keep deterministic operations in command phases and judgment calls in agent phases.
4. Prefer `cwd_mode: task_root` for git, build, and test commands.
5. Add schedules, triggers, and daemon tuning only after the base workflow works manually.
6. Validate against current `ao-cli` behavior when docs and examples disagree.

## Rules

1. Use agent phases for decisions and command phases for deterministic execution.
2. Do not add rework loops to command phases.
3. Stagger cron offsets instead of starting every schedule on the same minute.
4. Restart the daemon after changing workflow YAML.
5. Keep `auto_merge: false` and `auto_pr: false` in daemon config unless the project intentionally wants daemon-level automation.
6. Use `default_workflow_ref` when the repo should have a stable implicit default.
7. Prefer pack refs like `ao.task/standard` over copying bundled behavior into project YAML.

## Validation

Validate and inspect the effective config before restarting the daemon:

```bash
ao workflow config validate
ao workflow config compile
ao workflow definitions list
ao workflow phases list
```

If the workflow is still unclear after that, open the specific reference file that covers the missing section instead of broad-reading the whole skill set.
