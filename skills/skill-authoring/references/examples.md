# Examples

Use this reference when you need a fuller example or workflow composition pattern.

## Use skills in agent profiles

```yaml
agents:
  my-reviewer:
    skills:
      - code-review
      - security-review
    tool: claude
    model: claude-sonnet-4-6
```

## Use skills on a phase

```yaml
phases:
  security-audit:
    mode: agent
    agent_id: my-reviewer
    directive: "Audit the codebase for security issues."
    skills:
      - security-review
```

## Complete implementation skill

```yaml
skills:
  careful-implementer:
    name: careful-implementer
    version: "1.0.0"
    description: Implementation skill that prioritizes correctness over speed.
    category: implementation

        You are a careful software engineer. Before writing code:
        1. Read existing tests to understand expected behavior
        2. Check for similar patterns in the codebase
        3. Write code that follows existing conventions
        4. Run tests before committing
        5. Commit with descriptive messages
      directives:
        - Never modify test files unless the task explicitly requires it
        - Always check for existing utility functions before writing new ones
        - Use the project's existing error handling patterns
